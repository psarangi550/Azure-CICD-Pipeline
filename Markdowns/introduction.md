# here we will be Learning about the below topics

- `Introduction to Devops` :-Learn th `fundamental of DevOps`

- `Devops Tools Required for this CICD Pipeline`

- `complete setup of the development environment`  

- `we will discuss about the branching startergy` and `how to use the source control tools`

- `Automated Testing` and `discuss what DevOps Automation Testing required for the DevOps Operation`

- `DevSecOps i.e  DevOps Security`  on the `Azure Devops Platform`  

- we will then setup the `MS Azure cloud Portal for Deployment` for a `Development application`

- how to `create an webapp` using the `asp.net core appication` and `Dockerfiles` for the same on the `project`

- configure the `several labs` for configuring `CICD Pipeline` over the `MS Azure DevOps Setup`

- how to `configure continious deployment CD release pipeline` for `Azure DevOps Platform`

- how to `promote` this `this CD Release pipeline` from `release` to `QA environment`

- we will learn about the `theory` of `Infrastructure as code`

- we can use `IaaC` tool such as `Terraform/Ansible/Shift/scriptinglanguage(powershell or python)`

- `Wrap of this video` 

- **Devops Architecture**

    - here we will be `VS Code inside the windows platform` and then `we will push the development app to git` and `then we will use git to push that to the azure Repo repository` and `there are several pipeline(build pipeline for deveploer) or (release pipeline to release to QA) can run from the azure repo` 
    
    - then we have the `Azure Portal` on the `environment` where it have the `azure container registry` and we will have to `push the docker image of the asp.net web application`
    
    - then it will have the `MZ app service` where the `webapllication been running will run` 
    
    - once we `push the docker image` then the `MS App Service` will `pull` the `latest docker image` and run the `MS App Service` as soon as the `new docker image been pusshed`
