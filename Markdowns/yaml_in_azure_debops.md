# New YAML Experience

- azure `DevOps` been `always "evolving and enhancing" the "user experience for the user"`

- if we are `going to the user settings` on the `right hand corner of the Azure DevOps portal` then `preview feature` we can see the `option` as `New YAML pipeline creation experience` 

- we can enable `any preview feature` after selecting the option `preview feature` from the `Azure DevOps Cloud`

- this `New YAML Pipeline creation experience` `if we enable the same` 

- then if we are going to the `New` (for building new pipeline) &rarr; `it will start with the differnt SCM repo`  which will tell where the `source code is ?`

- then we need to select the `SCM project` on which we want to `create the build pipeline`

- then it will ask for the `configuring the build pipeline` using the `repectiuve best template for the project Source Code` 

- then once `proceed` then it will `generate the  YAML file based on the template that choosed for the Build or CI Pipeline`

- we can also `override the default implementation of the YAMl file which being generated from the template that we have created`

- if qwe want to `run the Build Pipeline or CI` then we can clock on the `save and run in order to run the same`  

- for now we will not be going through the `New YAML pipeline creation exprience` rather we will be using the `visual designer tool` , hence we can disable to `New YAML pipeline creation experience`

- from the `Visual Designer` we still can generate the `YAML pipeline file` using the `export option` which cwe can see later

- we need to `go to the user settings in the azure portal` &rarr; `profile feature` and turn of the `New YAML pipeline creation experience`

- now when we are `creating the New Build Pipeline` the `Option will be different as compared to the New YAML Pipeline creation execution step`
