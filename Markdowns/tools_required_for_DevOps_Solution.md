# DevOps Tools Required 

- we will `few DevOps Tool` thats been required for the `Azure DevOps`

- `Azure Devops Platform` , `How to use the Azure DevOps Platform and What are these`

- `Setting up the Development envirnment using the Visual Studio code`

- `Git`

- `we will also need the Microsoft Azure portal to decie which services to Use from the Microsoft Azure platform`

- `we will use docker in our DevOps solution`

- `We will use the Azure Repos` as the `remote central repo for version control`

- `Testing Tool to automate the Unit and Testing Execution`


- `Introduction to Azure Devops Platform`
  
  - `Azure DevOps Platform` is a `platform` developed by `Microsoft`  which is a `SaaS` i.e `Software as Service`
  
  - `Azure DevOps Platform`  provide `toolset` with an `end-to-end DevOps Environment` for `developing and integrating and deploying software ` over a `Continious Development and Continious Deployment pipeline`
  
  -  it can integrated with  `Any Indrustry leading DevOps Tools` such as `Docker Registry` , `Kubernetes` , `Azure Portal` , `AWS` , `Sonarqube` and `GitHub` i.e on the `market place`
  
  
  - `Azure Platform` consist of `Key Services` such as 
    
    - `Azure Board` :- `This is to plan/Track/Discuss Work accross the Agile Team`
    
    - `Azure Pipeline` :- `we can build,test and deploy within the CICD Pipeline `
    
    - `Azure Repos` :- `act as the source control repo which integrate with Git`
    
    - `Azure Test Plan` :- `we can use the manual and exploratory testing tool test the project`
    
    - `Azure Artifacts`  :- `create and share packages within the team`


- the `Project Settings` of the `Azure DevOps Platform` we can set the `below things`
  
  - we can `add user` to the `Azure DevOps` inside the `Teams`
  
  - we can then `connect to services running on Azure DevOps Portal` 
  
  - we can also `create agent pool` to `spin the windows and Linux VM` to where we want to `Deploy the Apps`
  
  - then  `we can also handle the permission inside the General Project Settings`
  
  - we can also `remove the boards/repos/wiki/pipeline` 
  
  - we can also use the `made some configurational changes to the boards/repos/wiki/pipeline`



- **Docker**
  
  - Docker is a `PaaS` i.e `platform as service`
  
  - it provide `operating System Level Virtualization` to `package the application` which is known as `container`
  
  - the `Docker Container` run on a `isolated Environment from each other which is bundled as (Package and its dependency) and configuration files` and `can connect to each other through a particular channel`   

  - `Docker Image` can be the `final product` that been created by the build process `using the DockerFile`
  
  - We can deploy docker  to a  `Docker Host` or `Docker Registry` such as `Azure container registry` which is `similar to` the `Docker Store` to `store the image` 


- **Azure Repos**
  
  - `Azure Repo` is the `cloud Git repo` hosted on the `Azure DevOps Platform`
  
  - `we can connect the Azure Repo with the local git development` and `push the code from the local git repo to the Azure Repos `
  
  - we can use the `git client such as github Desktop in reference to the same to upload the project code`
  
  - we can set the `Azure CICD Pipeline` which will be triggered by the `Azure Repo` when `on change or code been checked`    
  
  - `Azure repo ` will impleemtn the `same branching model` as we have `create on your local git repo` by using the `azure repo clone functionality`
  
  - we can use the `VScode` to `integrate with` `Git` and `Azure DevOps Platform Azure Repos`
